\section{Introduction}
The general task is to classify lexical and auditory speech into one of four predefined \textit{dialog act classes}. A \textit{dialog act}, in this context, represents informal information of how a dialog system should respond to a users input. The four provided classes are \textit{statement, opinion, question} and \textit{backchannel}. To solve this task we developed \textit{convolutional neural networks} (CNN) that use lexical and acoustic features. For the development and training of the systems a subset of the \textit{Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus} was used. In next chapters we discuss the development of the systems and subsequently to that the research question \textbf{INSERT HERE}.

\section{Data \& Data Preperation}
In this section we discuss the \textit{Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus} and the extraction of the lexical and acoustic features.

	\subsection{The Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus}
	The \textit{Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus}, from now on abbreviated as \textit{SwDA}, consists of recordings with corresponding transcripts and \textit{dialog act classes}.
